# GD Deepfry-ifier
Hi, you've stumbled across a terrible project. Glorified death, is what this is. This repository hosts the application for deepfrying an entire folder at a random see. All configurations are in `config.js`, and with them; the instructions on what they do.

To run this program, please run this command in the directory of the deepfrier first.
```
npm install
```

And to run the program itself?
```
node app.js 
```

This application requires Node.js v12+ for usage.
